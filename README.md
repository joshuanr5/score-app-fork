## Score app

Sample score app made with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### Run the app

```bash
$ cd app-compose
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Api access

Just go to [here](http://localhost:3000/api) to play with the API

[This](http://localhost:8080) is the web app where you can see the matches, score and comments in real time

### TODO

- Create an admin dashboard to manage matches, score and comments
- Create a microservice for the socket
